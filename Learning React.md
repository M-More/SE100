### Why React?
#### Simple
React has quite a small API. This makes it fun to use, easy to learn, and simple to understand.
#### Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
#### Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

### Related Concepts

***React elements*** are JavaScript objects which represent HTML elements. They do not exist in the browser. They represent browser elements such as a `div` or `section`.

***Components*** are developer created React elements. They’re usually larger parts of the user interface which contain both the structure and functionality.  *e.g.* a `NavBar`, `LikeButton` or `ImageUploader`.
